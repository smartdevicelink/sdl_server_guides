# Policy Server Guide Content
Guide content for the [SDL Developer Portal](https://smartdevicelink.com/guides/sdl-server/getting-started/).

## How to Use This Guide

Documents in this guide are created in DocDown format. One repo is linked per platform. That means that all Policy Server guides get created as directories inside this repo. Each directory gets a link in the left-hand sidebar. Guides do not currently support multiple pages or sub-directories.

Learn how to use DocDown at the [spec page](https://github.com/smartdevicelink/sdl_markdown_spec).
