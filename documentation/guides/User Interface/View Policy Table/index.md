# Policy Table
For information on the different properties that make up the Policy Table object, refer back to the [Policy Table](../../api-reference-documentation/policy-table/overview/) documentation.

## Staging & Production
This page is for viewing an example Policy Table with functional groups and consumer messages available to the server. Staging is where any changes should be made and where any temporary entries should exist. Production is for finalized groups and messages that should no longer be changed. This example table will use the most recent version for the environment chosen. You can minimize certain properties by clicking anywhere there is "[]" or "{}".
