The migration scripts setup the tables necessary to contain all of the functional group info, consumer message info,  country information, etc., and populates those tables with the initial data from a default Policy Table. Any updates to this data will come through as another migration up script and a download from the repository will be needed to get those changes. An alert will appear in the UI to notify the user when a new version of the Policy Server exists.
